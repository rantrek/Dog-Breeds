# Dog-Breeds


## About the Dataset

The dataset can be downloaded from https://www.kaggle.com/c/dog-breed-identification/data

## Objective

The purpose of this project is to build a classification model to identify the breed of a dog from the image. 

## Program

The program is written in Python using Jupyter Notebook and run in Google colab (CNN model from scratch). Two new python files added - data processing (generates npy files to load for training) and training (pretrained CNN model).
